C#-TCP/IP-GUI
Useful TCP/IP user interface.
 
This interface wirtten in Visual Studio C#. The interface can be used as client or server, you can change it with radio buttons on the interface. The GUI has some bugs but i am still working on it so i will update when it changed, also you can write me if you develop or chenge it. I use this interface at my internship, i used it for TCP/IP communication test. It works like a charm on the socket side but as I said before the interface needs improvement.
